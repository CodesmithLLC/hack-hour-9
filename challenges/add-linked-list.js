/* You have two numbers represented by linked lists. Each node contains a single digit. The digits
 * are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write
 * a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list with the same
 * structure.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
 * Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
