UX
	Goal
		Make users effective
		Align user goals with business goals

	Psychology
		What are the users motivation?
		How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
		What habits are created if they do this over and over?
		What do they expect when they click this?
		Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?
		Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?
		Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
		How are you rewarding good behaviour?

	Usability
		Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
		Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)
		Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
		Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
		Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
		Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
		Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
		Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?
		If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

	Design
		Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
		Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
		Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
		Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
		Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?
		Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?

	Copy

	Analysis
		Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
		Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
		Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
		Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
		Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?
		How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
		Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
		How can you use this analysis to make improvements?



Sharding
	handle heavy loads
		alot of transactions
		add more hardware

	No single point of failure
		each shard is isolated
		if one fails, the entire system wont go down

	big servers
		$$$ software & hardware & people to maintain
		Response times get worse 
		performance less predictable

	sharding
		horizontal shards
		divide data across multiple containers
		scale containers independently
		uses some mechanism to route data to particular container
		use a shard key

	sharding mechanisms
		range sharding
			define ranges from data rows to store in each shard
			predictable 

			problems
				uneven distribution
					data is not uniform
				may see uneven activity
					can create hotspots
					early range deadzones

		list sharding
			shard base on data property
				group by specific attribute
			grouped items may use the same features
			easily identify growth patterns

			problems
				need deep understanding of underlying data groups
					to define shards
				may see uneven growth

		hash sharding
			apply hash function to a key to identify which container to place the data
			no hot spots
				even distribution

			problems
				difficult to redistribute
				resizing hash table (add a new server)

		consistent hashing
			each server handles a range of keys
			if new server add only a few get shifted

	problems
		routing
		reporting
		maintaining multiple servers
		managing growth
		cross-shard joins
		more complexity with sql when adding sharding logic
